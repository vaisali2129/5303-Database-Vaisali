## ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3R3r0z1g3G0o0r2T1i0t/heavy_exclamation_mark_symbol_emoji_2757.jpg) Important:

I cannot perform my job of assessing your work if you do not complete this assignment correctly. Therefore:
- If you don't complete it, drop the course because you will fail
- If you complete it late, you will lose 1 letter grade off of your final grade.
- If you complete it wrong, you will lose 1/2 of one letter grade off of your final grade.
- Having said that, feel free to get help from me at anytime.

#### What is Git?

>Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed,data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.<br><br>
As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License  [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)).

`Git != Github`

`Github` is a social site that allows programmers to share code with other programmers. It's also a great place to discover projects to work on, discover code to use in your own projects, and a great place to start a portfolio. Whereas `Git` is simply the revision control system that can be installed anywhere, and only used locally if that's the users choice. 

#### Why github for this course?

We will be using github this semester as a means of communicating, storing documents (assignments and programs), as well as 
a means to push your files to a central repository. So if your using a lab or personal machine, there's a centralized location that we both have access to. 

#### Create a Github account. 
- When you create a Github account, you must choose a `username`. 
- This is very important to remember, because you will email it to me in the next part of this assignment.
- Create a repository named:
    -`5303-Database-yourname`
    - replace the `yourname` with your first or last name to make it unique.
- Check the box that says: "Add a README.md file"

#### Edit the README.md 

- Edit the readme file on github and place your contact information inside along with a picture of YOU. NOT an avatar.
- Your readme should include:
    - Your image
    - Your first and last name
    - Your email address
    - Your website (if you have one)

#### Make me a contributer:

- Go to your repo settings and add `rugbyprof` as a collaborater.
- You can do this in the settings of your repository. 
- This is vital as I need access to your files with edit permissions.


#### Send me an email:

- `To`: terry.griffin@mwsu.edu
- `Subject`: 5303 Advanced Database - Assignment 1 

>
Hello Professor Griffin,<br><br>
My Name is: place your name here<br>
My Github username is: githubusername<br>
My Repository name is: your-repository-name

#### Rules for emailing me:

Every email must have a minimum of two items included:

- The course number and title in the subject:
    - `5303 - Advanced Database`
- Your name

I can't promise an answer if you don't provide those two pieces of information.
